# Park Smart Philly

[Pramod Jacob](https://github.com/domarp-j)

This Rails app will help you be smart about parking in Philadelphia.

## Features

* Simply submit the street address near you in the home page, and you'll see
recent parking violations near you! Use it to determine whether or not it's too
risky to park or keep your car at its spot for a little longer!
* Get a parking violation lately? We're sorry about that...but let us know
so that we can keep our records updated! That way, we can help you and other
user's be smarter about where they park!
* Join the community! Create an account, sign-in, and discuss places where you
should & shouldn't park. Help all Philadelphians park a bit smarter!
